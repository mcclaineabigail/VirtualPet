Welcome to Fuzzy's Animal Shelter?

Here at Fuzzy's we house many kinds of pets.


First you'll choose your pets name.
You can also interact with all your pets' needs.
When prompted you can choose to "feed","hydrate", and even "snuggle" to your heart's desire, by entering that keyword.
If you choose to feed your pet, the hunger level will decrease, but will also get thirsty.
As each need has been fulfilled, others will increase so remember to watch all of your pet's needs.

To End the game, simply enter "End Game", and you will exit the game.
